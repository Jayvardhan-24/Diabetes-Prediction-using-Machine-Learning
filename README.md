# Project Title

Diabetes Prediction using Machine-Learning.



## Project Overview

The project follows a structured pipeline to preprocess the data, engineer relevant features, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance. Key steps include data exploration, feature engineering, model selection, performance evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.


## DataSet Sources

 - [Kaggle](kaggle.com)
 - [Google DataSet Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)

## About
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

Loaded and explored the dataset for missing values, outliers, and general data structure.
Performed visualizations to understand feature distributions and their relationships with the target variable.


2. Feature Engineering:
Selected relevant features for the model.
Applied feature scaling and normalization as necessary.
Encoded categorical variables to ensure they are suitable for machine learning models.


3. Model Selection and Training:
Chose machine learning algorithms suitable for binary classification, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets and trained models on the training set.


4. Model Evaluation: 
Evaluated model performance using key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Employed confusion matrices and ROC curves to further analyze the modelâ€™s performance.


5. Hyperparameter Tuning: 
Performed Grid Search to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the best-performing model and optimize its performance.
